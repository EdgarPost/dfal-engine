## Workflow

### Git

To get the latest changes run `CTRL+p` (on Windows) and search for the command `Obsidian Git: Pull`.

When you are done with your changes, you have to commit your changes to your repository on your local machine first, and then push them to the remote repository. You can do this with the following commands:

- First, make sure you have pulled the latest changes with `Obsidian Git: Pull`
- Commit your changes with `Obsidian Git: Commit` or `Obsidian Git: Commit all changes with specific message` (a specific message is recommended to track changes!)
- Push your commits to the remote repository with `Obsidian Git: Push`

You can also set up your `Obsidian Git` configuration so that it automatically commits, pulls and pushes on certain intervals.

## Writing stories

The story unfolds itself by going through a series of cards. These cards are interactive and may hold some state, actions and references to other type of cards.

| Type         | Description | Example      |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| Card         |             | [[Card]]     |
| Location     |             | [[Location]] |
